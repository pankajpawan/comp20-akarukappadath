README - 2048 CHANGES

As far as I can tell, all aspects of the assignment have been correctly implemented.

I have received help from Ming Chow, classmate Josh Podolsky, and TA David Bernstein - thank you so much to all of you!
I have used Ming's class examples (feedme) and the solution that he posted as a template, but made sure to understand every aspect of what was going on within the code and implement it in my own way as well. 

I've spent approximately 10 hours on this assignment.
