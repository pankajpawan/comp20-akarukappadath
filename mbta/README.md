README - COMP20 - MBTA ASSIGNMENT - AZMINA KARUKAPPADATH

All aspects of this assignment have been implemented correctly. 

I have collaborated with Josh Podolsky during this assignment. I also used Ming's example of using the Google Maps API as a reference, used Stack Overflow to learn how to manipulate strings, and used this link (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript) as a reference to using the Haversine Formula in JavaScript. 

I spent approximately six hours on this assignment.
